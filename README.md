# WSL centered dotfiles
I made this because of the WSL issue with the Windows path being added to PATH with spaces. This makes the path when trying to "persist" the environment.
This is a liveable issue but why bother? it annoys me.

I can put this inside the .files folder I already have but I decided to do this (I might change this later)

I will be using:
* Stow to manage this
* Fish shell centered
* Ubuntu centric configs
* WSL specific configs.
* Don't bloat it with unecessary settings
